          <p>
            <b>
              Hi, I'm Thomas.
              <br>
              Welcome to my ePortfolio!
            </b>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I am a fourth year Bachelor of Mechatronics undergraduate engineer studying at the University of
            Technology
            Sydney. I am a hard-working student and have been able to consistently maintain a High Distinction average
            throughout my degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have always had a strong interest in the practical application of science, electronics and technology
            and
            have completed many mechanical hands-on personal projects making things in my workshop over the years. I
            also enjoy design. I also enjoy applying my creativity and detailing my ideas in a format that can be
            shared
            with others. I find it very rewarding to produce designs that go on to become successful products. I think
            these factors are what have led to my fascination in engineering, specifically mechatronics as it allows
            me
            to combine my interests in mechanical projects, electronics, and technology.
          </p>

              <p><i>Some goals for my future career</i></p>
              <div class="projects-wrap">

                <!-- <br> -->
                <p>
                  Looking forward, I would like to pursue an <b>early</b> career working in the manufacturing,
                  research,
                  or product development sectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Mid-term</b>, after gaining some more industry experience I would like to study an Engineering
                  Master's degree in my field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My <b>long-term</b> goal is to work in a management role in my chosen field of specialisation. I think
                  this sort of position would be highly rewarding allowing me to lead technology advancement within my
                  field. Being able to manage new innovations should also help me to pursue my goal of continual
                  lifelong learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Related to this goal of lifelong learning and continued development throughout my career I would like
                  to become a chartered professional through Engineers Australia (EA). This requires me to show
                  competency in a large range of different professional engineering skills.

                During my free time I enjoy working on a project to build a go-kart with 2 high school friends. This
                has
                involved collaborating with my friends to research, design, source materials and manufacture the go
                kart
                from scratch. The first successful test run of this go-kart was completed in 2018. However, since then
                we have been making various modifications and noting areas to improve for the next iteration.
              </p>

              <p>
                Additionally, I frequently make things with my 3D printing which I have used for many personal and
                university projects.

                Outside of my studies, I am committed to community service endeavours. I joined the fire brigade as I
                think it is an important job that needs to be done to protect local
                bushlands and the community. This has involved responding to rural bush fires, training new members,
                community engagement and maintaining local bushland. I also spent upwards of 180 hours volunteering
                during
                the Black Summer 2019-20 bushfires.

              <p>
                I led a group of 3 university students to research stakeholder requirements and develop an
                affordable and easy to construct cyclone resistant housing solution for small communities in Vanuatu.

                  <br>
                  <p><b>Task Management</p></b>

                  <p>
                    Throughout my university studies I have consistently been able to prioritise simultaneously group
                    and
                    individual project tasks to maintain a high distinction average grade. I have balanced these
                    university
                    commitments with other activities including volunteering with the NSW Rural Fire Service and part
                    time
                    work commitments.
                  </p>
                  During my engineering workplace experiences I have a proven record of balancing simultaneous project
                  tasks to achieve their successful and on time completion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, during my time at ResMed I successfully assembled and tested a complex end arm tool
                    industrial robot gripper used to automatically demould 100,000's of silicon masks annually in the
                    ResMed
                    manufacturing operations. I completed this while also reviewing and proposing improvements for the
                    current automated silicone demoulding methods and designing a rig that can performs prototyping
                    tests
                    for injection mould tooling.
                  </p>
                  <br>

                  <p><b>Communication and Teamwork</p></b>
                  <p>
                    I have developed my communication skills while working with Jaycar Electronics. This has required me
                    to carefully listen to customer electronics problems, ask good questions to ensure I have all the
                    information to then provide the most effective solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have also improved my team collaboration skills when volunteering in the NSW Rural Fire Service.
                    For
                    example, when working on active firegrounds effective communication is paramount to ensuring
                    efficient
                    response to fires and that everyone is remaining safe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have improved my communication skills during group university projects. A specific example is a
                    Laser Tag Robots project I completed with 8 students. This project required clear and consistent
                    communication to ensure all team members understood their tasks, how their tasks fit into the
                    project
                    scope and the various target deadlines.
                  </p>

                  <!-- During university group projects I also frquently lead collbotatyion during inversity project to
                  influence successful outcomes. -->
                  <br>

                  <p><b>Leadership</p></b>
                  <p>
                    During my university studies I have frequently led group projects to influence successful outcomes.
                    Applied these skills when leading a group of 3 other students to develop an affordable and easy to
                    construct cyclone resistant housing for small Vanuatu communities as part of the 2017 Engineers
                    Without Boarders Challenge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More recently I have led projects such as a technical demonstration robot capable of autonomously
                    playing basketball, a robot that acts as a bartender and assisted in leading a large 8 student team
                    to
                    create 2 robots capable of autonomously playing a laser tag game.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of my workplace experiences, I have been able to manage various projects. During my time at
                    ResMed, I was responsible for managing all project resources for successful assembly and testing of
                    an
                    industrial robot end of arm tool. Similarly, at BORG Manufacturing/Crossmuller I have managed design
                    of workshop manufacturing equipment and a vehicle storage system that utilised throughout the
                    company
                    sales fleet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, my volunteering with the NSW Rural Fire Service has also developed my leadership skills.
                    During the Black Summer 2019-20 bushfires I was able to lead and mentor newer less experienced team
                    members. I have also assisted in training 2 new team members, which consisted of running practice
                    drill sessions.

                    The project encouraged friendly competition between the student teams to see who could perform the
                    task
                    quickest. Using the design shown in the video, our team was able to place second in the cohort,
                    while
                    also maintaining one of the lowest budgets.

                  <p>As part of the 48623 Mechatronics 2 subject robotics design studio, I helped lead a team of 7 other
                    student to
                    design, fabricate and program 2 robots to autonomously play a laser tag game. These robots combined
                    many
                    different systems including, path finding algorithms, computer vision, localisation, laser aiming
                    and
                    driving motor control. These systems communicated between each other using Robot Operating System
                    (ROS).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the project I was responsible for developing a path finding algorithm allowing the robots to
                    navigate through a maze game area and writing a program to aim the lasers on each robot.
                    Additionally, I
                    collaborated with the team leaders to make various design decisions and guide other team members on
                    completing their project responsibilities.

                  <p>
                    Our team decided to significantly expand the scope of the assignment requirements, with the subject
                    coordinators describing our project as “bigger than Ben Hur”. Our group knew that the expanded
                    project
                    scope would be a good challenge, however decided to attempt it
                    any way as it would provide excellent learning opportunities regarding project management,
                    leadership,
                    and technical skills.

                  <p>At BORG Manufacturing/Crossmuller, I was assigned a project to develop a new vehicle storage system
                    across the company’s sales representative car fleet. The purpose for this was to improve safety,
                    efficiency and accuracy when travelling and demonstrating the line of products to potential
                    customers.
                  </p>
                  <p>I managed this project from initial concept development, through detailed design and into
                    manufacturing. I detailed this design using SolidWorks software for 3D modelling and drafting using
                    software. I also used Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to analyse the components to ensure structural
                    integrity and long-term reliability whilst minimising any additional mass in the vehicle. Trials
                    were

                    existing collection method that had limited capacity and would also spill creating mess.</p>
                  <p>I managed this project, through initial concept development with the stakeholders, detailed design,
                    and
                    manufacturing. I detailed my design using SolidWorks CAD software and performed extensive Finite
                    Element

                    important
                    part of the design process as the steel dust being support could collect to weigh upwards of 2000
                    Kg.
                    After consulting with colleagues for final sign off, my design was successfully manufactured with no

                    <br>
                    <p>For my final year of university study, I am currently completing a self-assigned capstone
                      research
                      project. My project will focus on teleoperation (i.e. remote control) of robot hand gripper using
                      hand
                      tracking technology. </p>
                    <p>Robotic arms are often teleoperated to perform tasks that are either dangerous or require
                      specific
                      physical capabilities exceeding that of a person. Current common methods of controlling these
                      robots
                      include joysticks, handheld controllers, and manual computer command inputs. Although these
                      methods
                      are
                      adequate, my project will research the potential for a more ergonomic and user-friendly control
                      method
                      for these robotic systems, which could greatly improve their effectiveness. This will be achieved
                      using
                      hand tracking technologies to control a robotic human hand manipulator that can mirror a person’s
                      own
                      hand movements. Communication of hand tracking data over a local or non-local network (internet)
                      will
                      also be researched to support applications where the robot and operator are not in the same
                      location.
                    </p>
                    <p>Potential technology options to implement this research include the leap motion controller hand
                      tracking device and the InMoov open-source 3D printed robot hand. These are shown in the
